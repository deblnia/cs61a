## Auditing cs61A 

The order of priority should be this: 

1. Projects (this is the main thing I want to do!) 
2. Labs 
3. Homeworks (especially if I feel shaky on a concept) 
4. Lectures 

This ordering preferences actually coding over passive learning. I assume I'll
use handouts / reference materials as needed.
